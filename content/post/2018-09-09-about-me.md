My name is Kim Eng KY. I go by Kim. I am a Cambodian national. 

In 2010, I won a scholarship to go to [UWC Red Cross Nordic](https://uwcrcn.no/) (UWCRCN), one of the [UWC](https://www.uwc.org/) colleges. UWCRCN locates in Flekke, a tiny village (like really tiny; think 300 people) in Fjaler, Sogn og Fjordane, Norway. While there, I got accepted into a few U.S. colleges, one of which was Macalester College in Saint Paul, MN. I started at Macalester in the Fall of 2012. I graduated with a double major in Applied Math & Statistics and Economics, and a minor in Computer Science in May 2016. 

Right after college, I joined [The Brattle Group](http://www.brattle.com/) as a research analyst in Washington, D.C. After seven months of working in the economic consulting firm, I decided to go for a more data-intensive type of job. In February 2017, I moved back to the Twin Cities for a data scientist position with [Metro Transit](https://www.metrotransit.org/). In August 2018, I left Metro Transit and joined [The UnitedHealth Group](https://unitedhealthgroup.com/) as a data scientist within their member experience team.

I started building this website with the intention to create and maintain an online portfolio of projects that I am able to publicly share. I hope that someone can learn from me like I have learned from many people who have maintained their online presence.
