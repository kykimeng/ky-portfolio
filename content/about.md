In August 2010, I boarded a plane for the first time in my life, leaving my beloved family and hometown behind to go chase after my dreams. I arrived in Norway 24 hours later, speaking little English and no Norwegian. I spent two years in Flekke, Norway at the United World College Red Cross Nordic doing International Baccalaureate with 200 other students who came from over 90 different countries, and who themselves had similar yet very different stories from mine. 

Two years after that first flight, I found myself again at the same airport saying farewell to my family and friends, but this time it was for a different destination. After over 30 hours of flying and getting delayed, I arrived in St. Paul, M.N. And there I spent four years studying Economics and Statistics at Macalester College. 

After graduating from Macalester, I moved to Washington, D.C. to join [The Brattle Group](http://www.brattle.com/), an economic consulting firm, as a research analyst in Litigation and Finance. My plan was to be an analyst for three years, get an MBA, and then go back as an associate. It did not take me long to realize that that career path, though an amazing one, was not for me. So, when I got an offer from [Metro Transit](http://www.metrotransit.org), back in Minneapolis, M.N., for a Data Scientist position, I decided to pack my bags and move back to Minnesota. I was with Metro Transit for a little over one and a half years before making another career move to join [UnitedHealthcare](https://www.uhc.com/), which is where I am at currently. 

These jobs have made me realize what I really am passionate about. I enjoy doing statistical modeling and data visualization. But more than that, I love learning new methods and applying them. It was not an easy path coming from a small town in Cambodia to where I am today. And, it would not be possible without help and support from everyone I crossed path with. So, I want to give back. This is one of the reasons why I started this blog. I hope that maybe someone would find the content useful. And I hope I can be an example for other young people out there whose dreams seem impossible that if you want it enough, it will happen eventually.
