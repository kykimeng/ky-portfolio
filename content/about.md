I am currently working as a data scientist at the [Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis](https://www.minneapolisfed.org/), Community Development Division. My background is in Economics and Statistics. I received my B.A. in Economics and Statistics from [Macalester College](https://www.macalester.edu/). I am currently pursuing an M.S. in Statistics at the [University of Minnesota](https://twin-cities.umn.edu/) as a part-time student. 

I have had professional experience in economic consulting, public transportation, healthcare, marketing and community development. 

When I am not working, I host meetups and plan conferences.
