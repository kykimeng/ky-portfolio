I am a data scientist at [the UnitedHealth Group](https://unitedhealthgroup.com/) (UHG) based in Minnetonka, MN. Prior to joining UHG, I worked briefly as a research analyst at [The Brattle Group](http://www.brattle.com/) based in Washington, D.C., and as a data scientist at [Metro Transit](https://www.metrotransit.org/) in Minneapolis, MN. I received my B.A. from Macalester College in Applied Math & Statistics and Economics.

My passion revolves around statistical modeling and data visualization. I am an R user. My favorite R packages include, but are not limited to, `data.table`, `ggplot2`, `shiny`, `leaflet`, `plotly`, `forecast`, `rstanarm`, `knitr`, and of course `blogdown`.
